Welcome to my blog. Here I will to share with you things that I've learned, be it software development related of just general stuff.

<!--more-->

I'm a software developer, currently working for Bellosoft, a UK software development company. 
I'm brazilian. Graduated in Computer Science. I started with games and web development at the end of 2016. Since then I've been working mostly with Asp.Net MVC/Core, EpiServer, and a little of VueJS. I worked with unity until 2019, when decided to leave games development behind.
In the last months though, I started to improve my skills on NodeJS, NextJS and React, as they are pretty useful for pet projects. But must say that it doesn't interfer with my wish to continue using/learning the MS technologies.

 <br/> :computer: &nbsp; Carrer focus: C#, ASP.Net, EPiServer, SQLServer, JavaScript.
 <br/> :book: &nbsp; Hobbies/Learning: Node.js, React, NextJS & Typescript.
 <br/> ðŸ’¬  &nbsp; About me: I like technologies in general, astronomy, games, rpg, :metal::skull::metal:metal:metal::skull::metal:, dogs, adventure books and movies.
