Starting from the scratch...

My name is Fernando Ramos Wolff. I am a software developer. Brazilian, from Santa Catarina. I am engaged with Adrielly and we are parents of two beautiful dogs, Bono and Kaira.

Graduated in Computer Science in 2018 by UNOESC-Videira. Currently working for [Bellosoft](http://www.bellosoft.com/), a software development company stablished on Brazil and United Kingdom with clients from different parts of the world.

I started with games and web development at the end of 2016. Since then I've been working mostly with Asp.Net MVC/Core, EpiServer, NopCommerce, Orchard Core, and a little of VueJS. 

On the Games side of things, I worked with Unity3D until 2019, when decided to leave games development behind. Games is a brutal market. For those of you that are still on it... #respect.

So I am focused on Web Development with MS technologies. Although, some months ago, I took some time to gain experience on NodeJS, NextJS and React, as they are pretty useful for pet projects - monetarely speaking -, and of course, people love those technologies. 

Although I really liked NodeJS, one does not simply gets to be a senior developer with .Net and also with NodeJS. As I intend to be a Senior Developer, I decided to leave NodeJS kind of aside and really focus on what matters for me and for the company I work to.

Do not get me wrong, I will take a sneak peek on NodeJS from time to time in order to see how it is doing and to be able to use it when I need it, without having to land with a parachute on it and be completely lost.
